# Tweaks
If you would like to play around with new colors, use the setting workbench.colorCustomizations to customize the currently selected theme.

For example, you can add this snippet in your "settings.json" file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
  "tab.activeBackground": "#282c34",
  "activityBar.background": "#282c34",
  "editorGroup.background": "#282c34",
  "sideBar.background": "#282c34"
}
```
