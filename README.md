# Egoist One

My fork of [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro). Customized for me.

# Tweaks
If you would like to play around with new colors, use the setting workbench.colorCustomizations to customize the currently selected theme.

For example, you can add this snippet in your "settings.json" file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
  "tab.activeBackground": "#282c34",
  "activityBar.background": "#282c34",
  "editorGroup.background": "#282c34",
  "sideBar.background": "#282c34"
}
```
